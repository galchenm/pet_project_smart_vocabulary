# 📚 **Project: Smart Vocab Builder for Foreign Language Reading**

## 🧠 Overview

This project is a smart vocabulary preparation tool designed for language learners who want to read books in a foreign language. It identifies the most important words from a given text (like a novel or article) and helps the learner master them *before* reading. The goal is to make reading more comprehensible, enjoyable, and productive—by learning the words that matter most *for that specific book*.

## 🎯 Use Case Example

> A Russian speaker wants to read “Der kleine Prinz” in German. They upload the German book into the app. The app analyzes the book, extracts the most important vocabulary needed to understand ~80% of the content, and generates personalized vocabulary lists, translations, and exercises. Once the user studies the words, they can begin reading with higher confidence and comprehension.
